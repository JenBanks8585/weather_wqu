## Weather project

This project demonstrates how to use Python to create web applications. It is primarily meant for educational purposes, specifically created for the WorldQuant University - Introduction to Data Science Module of the September 2020 session.

### The skills and tools used are:

* Python's requests package.
* Python's flask web framework.
* working with JSON.
* modular programming.

### When a client visits the application, it:

* gets the client's IP address.
* uses the IP address to look up their location.
* uses their location data to greet them with temperature of the city they are located in.

### Prerequisites
All required Python packages can be found in the requirements.txt file. Additionally, the provided Makefile can be used to create a virtual environment by running make venv. You will also need a Heroku account, and to have installed the Heroku CLI.
